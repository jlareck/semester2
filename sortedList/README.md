## Ordered list data structure
Implement data structure "ordered list" based on:

 - Linked list
 - Array list
 - Binary search tree
 - AVL-tree

Operations:

 - Add element
 - Delete
 - Search by value and range of values
 - Print in right order
 - Some function that will do smth with all elements (briefly speaking - map with specific function)

Also measure time and memory for all implementations.
