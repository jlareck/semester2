## Graph data structure
Implement following algorithms for graph data structure on adjency matrix and adjency list:

 - Find connected components
 - Depth first search for traversing
 - Dijkstra algorithm for finding shortest paths between two vertices
 - Topological sort using DFS
 - Spanning tree using DFS
 - Minimal spanning tree (reverse-delete)
